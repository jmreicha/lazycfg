# Ralph Wiggum Loop Progress Tracker

This file tracks the progress and learnings from autonomous Ralph Wiggum loop executions.
It serves as memory for the agent to improve over time by learning from past iterations.

## Format

Each entry should include:
- **Date/Time**: When the loop ran
- **Issue ID**: The beads issue being worked on
- **Iterations**: Number of iterations taken
- **Outcome**: Success/Failure/Partial
- **Key Learnings**: What worked well or what didn't
- **Improvements**: Suggestions for next time

## Progress Log

### Example Entry (Template)

**Date**: 2026-01-11
**Issue**: example-123
**Iterations**: 15 / 50
**Outcome**: Success
**Duration**: 2.5 hours

**What Worked**:
- Clear, specific issue description made task easier
- Small atomic commits helped track progress
- Running tests after each change caught bugs early

**What Didn't Work**:
- Initial approach to error handling was too complex
- Needed to refactor after iteration 8

**Key Learnings**:
- Always check existing patterns in codebase before implementing new ones
- Review AGENTS.md guidelines before starting
- Test edge cases explicitly

**Improvements for Next Time**:
- Add more detailed acceptance criteria to issues
- Review similar code before starting implementation
- Consider error handling approach earlier in the process
