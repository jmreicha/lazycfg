# lazycfg

A command line tool to simplify the creation and management of complicted configurations.

**Why?**

Imagine you are a new hire at a company and you need to set up your local
environment, but the setup process is complicated and involves multiple steps,
and everybody is busy. You need to install various tools, configure them, set up
your environment variables, etc. You also need to get connected to you cloud
environments, set Kubernetes configuration, and deal with other complicated
configs.

This setup process can be time-consuming and error-prone. Additionally, you may
not understand (or care about) security implications or know about advanced
configuration which you may want but don't know exist.

`lazycfg` aims to simplify all of this setup by providing a simple command line
interface to handle this for you so you can focus on more important things.
