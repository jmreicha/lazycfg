{"id":"lazycfg-6xv","title":"Build SSH config parser","description":"Build SSH config parser to handle Host blocks, directives, comments, and Include statements. Parse ~/.ssh/config structure correctly.\n\n## Decision: Use kevinburke/ssh_config Library\n\nAfter research, we will use the **kevinburke/ssh_config** library instead of building a custom parser.\n\n**Repository**: https://github.com/kevinburke/ssh_config  \n**GoDoc**: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kevinburke/ssh_config  \n**License**: MIT  \n**Status**: Active (v1.4.0, Aug 2025) | 456 stars | Used by 32,500+ repos\n\n### Why This Library\n\n✅ **Read AND Write support** - Full parsing with Decode() and generation with String()  \n✅ **Comment preservation** - Maintains comments during parse/write cycle  \n✅ **Include directive support** - Handles nested Include statements (max 5 levels)  \n✅ **Battle-tested** - Used in production by Cilium, Podman, go-git, Gitpod, Pulumi  \n✅ **Active maintenance** - Latest release Aug 2025  \n✅ **Simple API** - Straightforward to use  \n✅ **All standard directives** - Host, HostName, User, Port, IdentityFile, etc.\n\n### Usage Examples\n\n**Reading config**:\n```go\nimport \"github.com/kevinburke/ssh_config\"\n\nf, _ := os.Open(filepath.Join(os.Getenv(\"HOME\"), \".ssh\", \"config\"))\ncfg, _ := ssh_config.Decode(f)\n\n// Get single value\nport, _ := cfg.Get(\"example.com\", \"Port\")\n\n// Get multiple values (IdentityFile can appear multiple times)\nidentityFiles, _ := cfg.GetAll(\"example.com\", \"IdentityFile\")\n```\n\n**Writing config**:\n```go\n// Parse existing config\ncfg, _ := ssh_config.Decode(f)\n\n// Find or create host\nvar sshHost *ssh_config.Host\nfor _, host := range cfg.Hosts {\n    if host.Matches(\"example.com\") {\n        sshHost = host\n        break\n    }\n}\n\nif sshHost == nil {\n    sshHost = \u0026ssh_config.Host{}\n    cfg.Hosts = append(cfg.Hosts, sshHost)\n}\n\n// Add directives\npattern, _ := ssh_config.NewPattern(\"example.com\")\nsshHost.Patterns = []*ssh_config.Pattern{pattern}\nsshHost.Nodes = []ssh_config.Node{\n    \u0026ssh_config.KV{Key: \"User\", Value: \"ubuntu\"},\n    \u0026ssh_config.KV{Key: \"Port\", Value: \"22\"},\n    \u0026ssh_config.KV{Key: \"IdentityFile\", Value: \"~/.ssh/id_rsa\"},\n}\n\n// Write back\nos.WriteFile(configPath, []byte(cfg.String()), 0600)\n```\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Install library**:\n   ```bash\n   go get github.com/kevinburke/ssh_config@latest\n   ```\n\n2. **Create parser.go** in internal/providers/ssh/:\n   - Wrapper functions around ssh_config library\n   - ParseConfig(path string) function\n   - FindHost(cfg, hostname) helper\n   - AddHost(cfg, host) helper\n   - WriteConfig(cfg, path) with proper permissions (0600)\n\n3. **Key implementation notes**:\n   - Use mutex for concurrent config modifications\n   - Handle multiple values for directives like IdentityFile\n   - SSH requires strict file permissions (0600)\n   - Max Include recursion depth is 5\n   - Check host.IsImplicit() for implicit \"Host *\" entries\n\n4. **Testing strategy**:\n   - Create testdata/ with sample SSH configs\n   - Test parse → write cycle (round-trip)\n   - Verify comment preservation\n   - Test Include directive handling\n   - Test pattern matching with wildcards\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n⚠️ **No Match directive support** - The library doesn't support SSH Match blocks (rarely needed for basic configs)\n\nIf Match directive support is critical, we would need to either:\n- Contribute Match support to the upstream library\n- Use a different approach\n\nFor initial implementation, Host blocks are sufficient.\n\n## Real-World Usage\n\nThis library is used in production by major projects:\n- **YuukanOO/seelf** - Full CRUD operations with comment preservation\n- **Cilium/cilium** - SSH config parsing for test infrastructure\n- **Podman/podman** - SSH connection configuration  \n- **go-git/go-git** - Git SSH transport\n- **Gitpod** - Remote workspace SSH management\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Add dependency: `go get github.com/kevinburke/ssh_config@latest`\n2. Create internal/providers/ssh/parser.go with wrapper functions\n3. Write parser tests in parser_test.go\n4.
